No Q is not only good for students, but employers as well! A common problem at modern career fairs is the number of unqualified candidates who waste their time when they could be chatting with someone else. With No Q, only the students who meet the positions’ criteria will be able to apply, and from there the recruiter can invite them to talk in more detail at the career fair through our intuitive messaging system."
